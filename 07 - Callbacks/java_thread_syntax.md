# Java Thread Syntax with Lambda and Runnable

## Original Code Snippet

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000); // wait 1 second
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    callback.onDataReceived("Async Data");
});
t.start();
```

## Step 1: What `new Thread(...)` Expects

The `Thread` class has a constructor:

```java
public Thread(Runnable target)
```

So when you pass `() -> { ... }`, you are actually passing a `Runnable`.

## Step 2: Why Does the Lambda Work?

A lambda like:

```java
() -> {
    // code
}
```

is shorthand for implementing a functional interface.

Here, `Runnable` is a functional interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
```

So the lambda `() -> { ... }` is equivalent to:

```java
new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        callback.onDataReceived("Async Data");
    }
}
```

## Step 3: How Thread Uses It

- You passed a `Runnable` to `Thread`.
- When you call `t.start()`, internally the `Thread` class will call your `Runnable`'s `run()` method in a new thread of execution.

So this code is using the `Runnable` interface, **not** overriding the `Thread` class.

## âœ… Equivalent Without Lambdas

```java
Runnable task = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        callback.onDataReceived("Async Data");
    }
};

Thread t = new Thread(task);
t.start();
```

## ðŸ‘‰ Direct Answer

Your code:

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> { ... });
t.start();
```

is using the `Runnable` interface, passed into the `Thread` class constructor.

It's **not** overriding `Thread`, it's just giving `Thread` something to execute.
